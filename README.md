another start - but i hope a lasting one

We arrive here in Melbourne on 01-Feb-2016.
This is another attempt at something new. 
It is a change like no other, in which I am committed inspite of myself. 
My tendency to choose the low when given a choice, is not something that would do me any good here.
I have to strive and attain the best - there is nothing wrong in doing this.
There is no need to justify that you need the best - it is a given.
Everyone should strive to do that which he/she is capable of. This is a process of discovery.

We gain the strength of the temptation we resist. - RWE [more from RWE]
